# HW4
 RPG Game for HW4
 
Running list of things to fix:

-Add 2D array

-Make it so it doesn't break the game if your input isn't a number

Optional potential good adds:

-Exp that levels you up. Level ups increase base stats

-Tracker the the monsters you've killed, exp earned, maybe gold earned

-Removal of creatures after first kill, Maybe something after game if you've killed them all without resetting

-Could add drawn monster/ability arts that play after uses. Would make the game more visually interesting
